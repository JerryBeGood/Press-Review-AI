# Product Requirements Document

## 1. Overview

- **Feature/Project Name:** Autonomous Press Review Agent
- **Owner:** Founder/Developer
- **Goal:** To experiment with and showcase the capabilities of an autonomous AI agent for content research, synthesis, and generation within a portfolio project.

## 2. Problem Statement

Manually creating a press review is a time-consuming process. It requires sifting through vast amounts of online information, identifying relevant articles, and synthesizing them into a coherent summary. This process is repetitive and inefficient, taking valuable time away from analysis and strategic thinking.

## 3. Solution

An autonomous AI agent that, when triggered, automates the entire press review creation process. The agent will use a predefined topic and time scope (derived from the press review's schedule settings) to search for relevant articles, generate summaries, and compile a complete press review document. This allows the user to generate comprehensive press reviews with a single click.

## 4. User Stories

- **As a user,** I want to manually trigger the generation of a press review for a topic I've already configured, so I can get an up-to-date summary on demand.
- **As a developer,** I want the agent to automatically determine the time range for its research (e.g., daily, weekly) based on the press review's schedule settings, so that the generated content is always relevant to its configured frequency.
- **As a developer,** I want the agent to generate and save detailed logs of its process (e.g., search queries, sources visited, decisions made), so I can debug and improve its performance.

## 5. Scope

- ✅ **Must-Haves:**
  - Manually triggerable agent-based generation for an existing press review topic.
  - Agent uses the press review's schedule (daily, weekly, monthly) to define the time scope for its research.
  - Agent performs autonomous web research to find relevant articles.
  - Agent synthesizes findings into a structured press review format (main summary + individual article summaries with links).
  - The final press review is saved and available in the archive.
  - Agent execution logs are saved to the backend for debugging purposes.

- ❌ **Out of Scope:**
  - Automatic, scheduled generation (cron job).
  - User interface for viewing agent logs.
  - User-facing real-time feedback on agent progress.
  - Any customization of the agent's instructions or tools by the end-user.

## 7. Tech Notes

- **Platform:** Web (Astro)
- **Tools:** Vercel AI SDK, Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet
- **Dependencies:** Relies on the existing press review configuration (for topic and schedule) and database schema.

## 8. Success Metrics

- **System Stability:** The agent can successfully complete an end-to-end press review generation run without errors.
- **Output Quality:** The generated press review is coherent, relevant to the topic, and correctly formatted.
- **Process Logging:** Agent logs are successfully created and saved, providing clear insight into its execution path.

# AI Rules for Press Review AI

Press Review AI is a web application designed to automate the process of creating regular press reviews on topics selected by the user. The main purpose of the product is to provide users with condensed, accurate and high-quality information from various sources, allowing them to save time and stay up to date with the latest trends in their areas of interest. The application uses an AI agent to autonomously search, analyse and synthesise content.

The project is educational in nature and forms part of a portfolio.

## Coding practices

### Guidelines for clean code

- Use feedback from linters to improve the code when making changes.
- Prioritize error handling and edge cases.
- Handle errors and edge cases at the beginning of functions.
- Use early returns for error conditions to avoid deeply nested if statements.
- Place the happy path last in the function for improved readability.
- Avoid unnecessary else statements; use if-return pattern instead.
- Use guard clauses to handle preconditions and invalid states early.
- Implement proper error logging and user-friendly error messages.
- Consider using custom error types or error factories for consistent error handling.
